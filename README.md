This basic Shiny web application shows my work location after user clicks a 'find me' button

It starts showing a map of Manhattan (New York) and prompts the user to click the "find me" button to show my work location within the city. After that button is clicked, a view of my location appears, with a big arrow (made up of circles) pointing to the precise location. This is a fancy way to replace the typical marker.

Once the location is shown, a text appears below showing the date the app was created as well as the the time interval between creation and user usage. If the "find me" button is clicked repeatedly, a funny message appears.
